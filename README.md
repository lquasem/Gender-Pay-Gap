"Equal pay for equal work is the concept of labour rights that individuals in the same workplace be given equal pay. ... Since President John F. Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act of 1963, it has been illegal in the United States to pay men and women working in the same place different salaries for similar work."

Our project explores the statistics some of the areas ways where women are constantly falling behind their male counterparts.
We took 2016 data from 45 countries around the world and looked at the annual earnings of each gender and compared the differences.
These were the following topics that we studied further:

•	Global Gender Gap
•	Overall Gender Gap in U.S.A
•	Gender Gap by Race
•	Gender Gap by Occupation
•	Gender Gap Education

The main goal was to produce a dashboard that explored the above topics… we used the following approach to create our dashboard:

•	Data cleaning in Jupiter notebook
•	Connecting to Postgres database
•	Data upload into SQL database
•	Python connection to SQL database
•	Using flask map routes
•	Flask app retrieving data from database and integration for the final dashboard
